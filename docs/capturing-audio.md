## Capturing Audio

By default, OBS Studio should be configured to capture both your desktop audio and microphone input audio.
To test this, ensure that the volume bars in the audio mixer section properly display feedback based on audio activity.

Speak into your microphone. The 'Microphone Capture' volume bar should rise accordingly. 
If there is sound coming from your computer, the 'Audio Output Capture' volume bar should rise accordingly.
