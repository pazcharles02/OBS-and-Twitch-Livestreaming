## Go Live

Once you have all your scenes, sources, and audio devices set up, the last step is to go live!

### Going Live on Twitch

Let's start by navigating to the front page of Twitch. You can do so by clicking [here.](https://twitch.tv)

**Note: If you have already signed up and have access to an account, skip this part by clicking [here.](https://pazcharles02.github.io/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/docs/go-live/#logging-in-on-twitch)**

### Signing Up on Twitch

Once on the front page, if you don't have an account yet, you will need to sign up. You can do so by:

**1.** Click "Sign Up" on the top right of the front page of Twitch.

A pop-up window will appear, and here, you have to fill out your information. Once that is complete,

**2.** Click "Sign Up" at the bottom of the window.

You will then see another window which tells you to verify your email address. You can choose to skip this part, or you can also enter your code. For the sake of this tutorial, we will skip this part by:

**3.** Click "Remind me later"

**6.** Click done!

Now that you've successfully signed up for an account with Twitch, move on to [Logging In on Twitch.](https://pazcharles02.github.io/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/docs/go-live/#logging-in-on-twitch)

### Logging In on Twitch

To log in to Twitch, let's begin by going to front page of Twitch first. You can visit this page [here.](https://twitch.tv)

**Note: If you do not see the "Log In" button on the top right of this page, move on to [this section.](https://pazcharles02.github.io/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/docs/go-live/#getting-your-stream-key-on-twitch-to-go-live)

Once on the front page, if you still see the "Log In" button on the top right of the front page of Twitch, you haven't logged in yet, and need to do so. You can do this by:

**1.** Click "Log In."

![Twitch Log In Button](https://github.com/pazcharles02/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/twitch_front_page_log_in.png?raw=true "Twitch Log In Button")

You will see a popup window where you will need to fill out your username and password from when you signed up with Twitch. Enter those details and log in.

![Twitch Logging In](https://github.com/pazcharles02/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/twitch_logging_in.png?raw=true "Twitch Logging In")

Once you've entered your information, click "Log In."

After successfully logging in, move on to the next section to finally start streaming!

### Getting Your Stream Key on Twitch to Go Live

Now that you have a Twitch account logged in and your OBS set up, we're going to do the final steps so that you can go live. In order to connect your OBS to your Twitch account, we'll need to get your stream key, which is what this section will teach you how to do!

Start by navigating to the front page of Twitch. You can visit this page [here.](https://twitch.tv)

**1.** Click on your profile icon in the top right of the page

![Twitch Accesing Profile Icon](https://github.com/pazcharles02/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/twitch_access_profile_icon.png?raw=true "Twitch Accessing Profile Icon")

**2.** Click on "Creator Dashboard."

![Twitch Accessing Creator Dashboard](https://github.com/pazcharles02/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/twitch_creator_dashboard_icon.png?raw=true "Twitch Accessing Creator Dashboard")

This is the Creator Dashboard! This is where you can find all sorts of settings and options to customize and edit your channel and stream.

On the left sidebar of your creator dashboard,

**3.** Click "Settings"

![Twitch Creator Dashboard Settings](https://github.com/pazcharles02/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/twitch_creator_dashboard_step1.png?raw=true "Twitch Creator Dashboard Settings")

A dropdown will appear, and now,

**4.** Click "Stream"

Before accessing your stream key, remember that it is really important to keep your stream key to yourself and not share it with anyone else. This is the sole piece of information anyone needs to be able to stream to your channel. Keep it hidden from anyone and everyone at all times.

Finally, to get your stream key, 

**5.** Click "Copy"

![Twitch Stream Key](https://github.com/pazcharles02/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/twitch_stream_key.png?raw=true "Twitch Stream Key")

There you have it! Your stream key is now copied to your clipboard, and all we have to do is paste it into OBS.

### Putting your Stream Key Into OBS

With OBS Open, navigate to the settings page by:

**1.** Click Settings near the bottom right of OBS.

![OBS Settings Button](https://github.com/pazcharles02/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/OBS_settings_button.png?raw=true "OBS Settings Button")

**2.** Click "Stream"

![OBS Stream Settings Button](https://github.com/pazcharles02/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/OBS_stream_settings_button.png?raw=true "OBS Stream Settings Button")

**3.** Click on the drop-down menu beside "Service" and select Twitch.

![OBS Streaming Service](https://github.com/pazcharles02/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/OBS_streaming_service.png?raw=true "OBS Streaming Service")

**4.** Right Click the text-box beside "Stream Key" and click "Paste." An alternative to this is left-clicking on the text box and pressing *Ctrl + V* on Windows or *âŒ˜ + V* on Mac OS.

![OBS Stream Key](https://github.com/pazcharles02/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/OBS_stream_key.png?raw=true "OBS Stream Key")

![OBS Stream Key OK](https://github.com/pazcharles02/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/OBS_stream_key_OK.png?raw=true "OBS Stream Key OK")

And you're done! Your stream key has been set up, and all you need to do to start streaming and go live now is to click the "Start Streaming" button in OBS!
