## Creating Scene

*Before doing anything, keep note we are working with OBS version 26.1.1*

With OBS open, start by looking towards the bottom left of the window.

**1.**  Click the + button.

![OBS Scenes Window](https://github.com/pazcharles02/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/highlight_scene_window.png?raw=true "OBS Scenes Window")

![OBS Add Scene Button](https://github.com/pazcharles02/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/highlight_plus_button.png?raw=true "OBS Add Scene Button")

Now, a new smaller window should pop up on your screen and a text box will appear, as well as two buttons labelled "OK" and "Cancel." 

**2.** Click on the text box and name the scene accordingly.

For a scene that would be for gameplay, we suggest you name the scene after the game you're trying to capture. For a scene that would be solely for your webcam, we suggest you name it specifying that it's only for your webcam. 

**3.** Click the "OK" button.

## Conclusion

Now that you have created a scene, head over to [Capturing Display With Source](https://pazcharles02.github.io/OBS-and-Twitch-Livestreaming/docs/capturing-display-with-source/) to learn how to populate it with the things you would like to record!
