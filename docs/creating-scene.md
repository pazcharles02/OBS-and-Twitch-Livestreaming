## Creating Scene

*Before doing anything, keep note we are working with OBS version 26.1.1*

**1.** With OBS open, start by looking towards the bottom left of the window and click the + button.

Now, a new smaller window should pop up on your screen and a text box will appear, as well as two buttons labelled "OK" and "Cancel." Click on the text box and name the scene accordingly. For a scene that would be for gameplay, we suggest you name the scene after the game you're trying to capture. For a scene that would be solely for your webcam, we suggest you name it specifying that it's for your webcam. 

**2.** Once you've settled on a name you're satisfied with, click the "OK" button.
