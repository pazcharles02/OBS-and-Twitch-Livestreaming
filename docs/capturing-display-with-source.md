## Capturing Display with Source

Now that you have created a scene, you can now build the look of your stream by layering sources on it.

If your stream is focused on real-life activity (e.g. Use of camera to record a fitness sessions), skip to capturing camera. 

To capture your entire desktop, create a new 'Display Capture' source, and select your monitor.

To capture a specific window, create a new 'Window Capture' source, and select the window from the drop-down menu.

If you intend to capture a fullscreen application or game, make sure it is running, then create a 'Game Capture' source.

1. We recommend using the mode 'Capture Specific Window', as this gives you the most control over which application OBS detects and captures.
2. Select your app/game from the drop-down 'window' menu
3. Press 'OK'

Should you need to change these capture settings at any time, right click the source, view properties, and select a different program to capture from the drop-down menu.
