## Glossary

**OBS**: Open Broadcaster Software is a free and open-source cross-platform streaming and recording program built with Qt by Hugh "Jim" Bailey and maintained by the OBS Project.

**Scene**: OBS canvas comprised of at least one visual element (source), all of which can be resized, repositioned or altered with filters.

**Source**: Captures the source of video, image, or audio content for display on a scene.

**Scaled Resolution**: Scaling is what is done when your video source resolution doesn't match your display's native or physical resolution. Using a scaled-down output resolution reduces rendering workload on the encoder.

**Bitrate**: The number of bits per second that can be transmitted along a digital network.
